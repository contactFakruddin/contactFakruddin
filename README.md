👋 Hey there! I’m Fakruddin — a BCA grad from Navrachana University 🎓, and a passionate UI/UX Designer on the hunt for full-time roles 💼.

🛠️ With 2+ years of hands-on design and development experience — including 6️⃣ months of client-side work — I specialize in crafting smooth, intuitive, and user-centered digital experiences ✨. Whether it’s wireframing, prototyping, or pixel-perfect UI, I love turning ideas into real, impactful designs 🚀.

🌱 Always learning. Always curious. I’m constantly exploring the latest design trends, sharpening my skills, and geeking out over cool animations, layouts, and interactions 🤓🎨.

💡 Looking to collaborate on design-forward projects, creative experiments, or just vibe over shared tech passions? Let’s connect and build something awesome together!
